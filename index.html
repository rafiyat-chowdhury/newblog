                <h3>Hack to total mind control</h3>
                <p class="articlecontent">Discipline, focus and drive. All which seem to be decreasing as the years go by. Everyone is distracted, eyes glued to their phones, watching rubbish on netflex. It's no wonder you have no control of your lives.</p><br>
                <p class="articlecontent">These three steps are what you need to condition into your mind:</p>
                <br>
                <p class="articlecontent">1. <strong>Be the man.</strong> By this I mean take responsibility. Everything in your life good and bad is all your fault. You alone have the ability to change things. Beware, your complacency will lead you to live a mediocre life.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="articlecontent">2. Look around you and see everyone who is excelling in life. Why aren't you one of them? What was different about your life and theirs? Did you parents not feed you? Did your parents not struggle? You need to look at your family and remeber your ancestors and all they've struggled for. You need to make them proud.<strong> Step 2 is about looking around yourself and being analytical of the life of yours and that of others. This will give you the drive!</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p class="articlecontent">3. <strong>Speed kills.</strong> You need to constantly attack your goal or problem or life from different angles. You will not succeed at first. But guess what if you haven't stopped if you haven't given up then it mean you did not fail. This applies to everything in life. I have been constantly rejected from jobs to this day. You need to keep moving, keep learning, keep upskilling. Be better than yesterday.</p>
